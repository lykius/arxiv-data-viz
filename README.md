# arXiv Data Visualization

Instructions:
- Download the dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/Cornell-University/arxiv/).
- Extract the `.json` file from the `.zip` file, rename it `arxiv.json` and place it in the `data` directory
- Use `years_and_categories.ipynb` to generate the visualization about the most active research fields in the last years
- Use `countries.ipynb` to generate the visualization about the provenience of the papers submitted to arXiv in the last months. This notebook requires you to collect data in advance with the script `countries.py`: this will take a very long time (~2 days). The `data/countries` directory contained tha data collected about the period `2020/08 2020/10`.
